            <h1>Hi, I'm Josiah!</h1>
            <h1>As a young boy, I fell in love with all things computers... especially coding.
            At the age of 9 I discovered Codecademy and getting me off of that website was near impossible. I devoutly enjoyed learning the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
            I continued to learn about web development throughout high school and while working in restaurants.
            I then decided to continue my education by attending Flatiron School, a 3-month software engineering bootcamp,
            where I learned a variety of skills like React, Ruby(on Rails), and a wide variety of other basic programming knowledge.
